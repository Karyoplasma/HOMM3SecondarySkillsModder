# HOMM3SecondarySkillsModder

# CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A COMPLETE REWRITE. DO NOT BUILD THIS CODE UNTIL THIS MESSAGE DISAPPEARS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Tool with a basic GUI, able to mod the secondary skills of heroes in HOMM3 (the HotA-exclusive heroes from Cove town are not included - maybe in a future update =))

Open the jar-File, navigate to your h3hota.exe or Heroes3.exe and press open. Edit the hero, then press "Update Hero" to save the changes you made. It will show a confirmation in the text area on the right. At this point, your executable will still be unchanged, so if you wish to discard your changes, just exit the program. To write the changes to the exe, press "Unlock" and then press "Write file".
